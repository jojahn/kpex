== Introduction

// <Rechtfertigung der Arbeit>
There are many programming languages. These programming languages can be combined into different types. For example object oriented languages like Java or Ruby. Other types are functional programming languages. These programming languages are purely based on functions. The majority of programming languages share features of other types and are not of a single type. 

=== Functional Programming

Examples for functional programming languages are F#, Haskell and Elixir. 

// <Functional Programming Languages Usescases>

=== What is Go?

Go is a multi-paradigm programming language. It allows object oriented programming. Go is developed by Google.

[quote, https://golang.org]
____
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

=== What is Elixir?

In contrast to Go Elixir is a pure functional programming language. Elixir uses the Erlang. Erlang libraries can be used in Elixir. This was a key features for the developers

[quote, https://elixir-lang.org]
____
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
____

Elixir has similar use cases to Go.

=== Differences

Although Go is not a pure functional language it has many features of functional programming languages. And thus it can be compared with a functional programming language like Elixir.

==== Orthogonal Classifications

Since modern programming languages have features of many types like object orientation or functional programming, programming languages can more differentiated with orthogonal classifications. Just like Go that has C++ background Elixir builds on top of the language Erlang. Various orthogonal classifications are listed in the Table <<_orthogonal_classifications,Orthogonal Classifications>>.

Elixir in comparison to Go has dynamic types, meaning it will evaluate types at runtime. The Elixir 

==== Types

Elixir and Go have different types and typing approaches. Elixir for example does not have strict types. Much like languages like coffeescript types in Elixir can be added through annotations or decorators.

func t(x Function) Function {
	return func(y Function) Function {

	return func(y Function) Function {

}

This is another paragraph.footnote:[I am footnote text and will be displayed at the bottom of the article.]

=== Second level heading

.Unordered list title
* list item 1
** nested list item
*** nested nested list item 1
*** nested nested list item 2
* list item 2

This is a paragraph.

.Example block title
====
Content in an example block is subject to normal substitutions.

.Sidebar title
****
Sidebars contain aside text and are subject to normal substitutions.

.Listing block title
----
Content in a listing block is subject to verbatim substitutions.
Listing block content is commonly used to preserve code input.
