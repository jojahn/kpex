== Introduction

// <Rechtfertigung der Arbeit>
There are many programming languages. These programming languages can be combined into different types. For example object oriented languages like Java or Ruby. Other types are functional programming languages. These programming languages are purely based on functions. The majority of programming languages share features of other types and are not of a single type. 

=== Functional Programming

// <Functional Programming Languages Examples>

=== Go

Go is a multi-paradigm programming language. It allows object oriented programming.

[quote, https://golang.org]
____
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
____

// <Usecases>

=== Elixir

In contrast to Go Elixir is a functional programming language. Elixir uses the 

[quote, https://elixir-lang.org]
____
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
____

// <Usecases>

=== Comparison

Although Go is not a pure functional language it has many features of functional programming languages.

=== Example Application

== First level heading

This is a paragraph with a *bold* word and an _italicized_ word.

.Image caption
image::image-file-name.png[I am the image alt text.]

This is another paragraph.footnote:[I am footnote text and will be displayed at the bottom of the article.]

=== Second level heading

.Unordered list title
* list item 1
** nested list item
*** nested nested list item 1
*** nested nested list item 2
* list item 2

This is a paragraph.

.Example block title
====
Content in an example block is subject to normal substitutions.
====

.Sidebar title
****
Sidebars contain aside text and are subject to normal substitutions.
****

==== Third level heading

[#id-for-listing-block]
.Listing block title
----
Content in a listing block is subject to verbatim substitutions.
Listing block content is commonly used to preserve code input.
