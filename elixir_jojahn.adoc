== Introduction

// To bring order into the chaos of immense amount of programming languages out there ,they can be classified by paradigsm.

The numerous programming languages can be separated into different paradigms. Examples are object-oriented, procedural and functional programming, all of which can be done in Go and in Elixir: two modern programming languages that have similar usecases. Paradigms define how programms are developed. Many newer programming languages adopted features of other languages and are multi-paradigm. The main goal of this arcticle is to compare Go with Elixir regarding the paradigm of functional programming.

=== Functional Programming

Functions in computer science can be understood as systems that take input, process it and then produce output.

Functional programming promotes a coding style that helps developers write code that is short, concise, and maintainable.

Functional programming is defined by many concepts that differentiate it from other paradigms. One key concept is that functions are first-class citizens. First-class citizens of a programming language are treated equally to primitive types like strings or numbers. This means that a function can be a return type, assigned to variables and passed as arguments to functions. A very helpful concept is anonymous functions that can be directly assigned to a variable without prior declaration. 

Functional programming includes higher-order functions that can be called with a function as an argument, return a function or do both. 
// <Composition,Closure, Currying, Higher Order>
The arity of functions gives information about the number of arguments. Some functional concepts require functions only with arity one or unary. Unary functions are functions that only take one arugment. To implement functions with more arguments currying comes into play. Currying describes ...

Programming languages that only support some parts of functional programming or are not only functional are called pure. Pure functional programming does not support loops, if-else or switch statements. Instead these types of languages use recursion.

Examples for functional programming languages are F# and Haskell. Functional programming languages have the effect of ...

=== Go

Go is a multi-paradigm programming language. It allows object-oriented, functional and procedural programming. Go was developed by Google employees in 2009 as an open source programming language. In the development of Go compilation times was a key feature. Go itself stems from a C\++ background, sharing some similarities with C++.

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
____

Go is more simple than C\++ since it has fewer keywords and has ditched pointer arithmetic. Go shines as the programming language of the backbone of cloud native stack. It is used in the area of application programming for cloud and the web. Other areas of Go are network and distributed systems. Go is used in webservers and cloud infrastructure. It was not developed as a UI language but there still exist GTK and QT C++ bindings for Go. Go can also be used in embedded devices using the compiler TinyGo which is optimized for microcontrollers.

=== Elixir

Elixir is also a multi-paradigm programming language. It was built on top of Erlang, a more functional programming language designed for telecommunication backends. Elixir therefore uses the Erlang VM. Erlang libraries can be used in Elixir. This was a key feature for the developers. Elixir is not pure functional since it has features like loops, switches and if-else statements. Even object-oriented programming is possible.

____
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
____

Elixir has similar usecases to Go.
// <usecase differences>
Elixir can also be run on embedded hardware using Nerves which is an IoT platform. 
// <Area>
// <Fault tolerant, scaleable>

Unlike Go Elixir requires a seperate build tool and package manager. The build tool of Elixir is called mix and it formats, runs tests, compiles and runs compiled Elixir source code. Mix is installed along the Elixir compiler.

== Functional Programming in Go

[discrete]
==== Primitive Types

Go has common datatypes like integers, floating point numbers, strings, arrays and many more. While declaring variables it should be noted that the variable type follows the variable name.

.types.go
[source,go]
----
// Primitive Types
var myBoolean bool = false || true
var myString string = "Hello, World!"
var myInteger int = 1 // uint, int8..int64, unit8..uint64,
var Float32 float32 = 1.0 // float64

// Arrays, Slices and Maps
var array [3]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}
var slice []int = array[0:]
var Map map[string][]int = make(map[string][]int)
----

[discrete]
==== Functions

Here is a basic example of a function in Go. This function takes two integers and returns the sum. The shortened `func` keyword prefixes a function and the return type follows after the argument list.

.types.go (functions)
[source, go]
----
func add(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

add(2, 2) // == 4
----

The casing of the name sets whether the function is private or public. Private functions start with a lowercase symbol and cannot be accessed outside the current file. Go also has interfaces and structs.

[discrete]
==== First-class citizens

Functions as first-class citizens imply that functions are treated the same as other natural datatypes and can be stored inside a variable.

.first_class_citizens.go
[source, go]
----
var add func(int, int) int = func (a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}
add(2, 2) // == 4
----

An anonymous function is stored in the variable add. The call of the anonymous looks exactly the same as the prior defined function using the `func` keyword. 

[discrete]
==== Higher-order functions

Go functions can be higher-order, which include a function as a parameter, return a function or do both. The Go programming language does not support Javalike streams and the functional concepts map, filter and reduce. An example for a custom implementation for a streaming api is given in link:stream/stream.go[stream.go]. Only an extract is provided here. 

.stream.go
[source, go]
----
func (s StreamImpl) Filter(p func(a interface{}) bool) StreamImpl {
	// ...
}
----

The function `Filter` takes an predicate function as an argument `p` that evaluates if an item of the stream should be skipped. The predicate function is defined by the `func` keyword. This predicate takes an `interface{}` which can be anything and returns a boolean.

[discrete]
==== Currying

Currying implies that higher-order functions exist and that functions can be returned from other functions. A curried function in Go can be implemented by returning a anonymous function.

.currying.go
[source, go]
----
func multiply(a int, b int) int {
	return a * b
}

func multiplyC(a int) func(int) int {
	return func(b int) int {
		return a * b
	}
}

func main() {
	multiply(2, 2)
	multiplyC(2)(2)
}
----

The curried function `multiplyC` can be called.

[discrete]
==== Composition

With composing functions ...

.composition.go
[source, go]
----
type any interface{}
type function func(any) any

func compose(f, g function) function {
	return func(value any) any {
		return f(g(value))
	}
}

func square(x any) any {
	return x.(int) * x.(int)
}

func main() {
	compose(square, square)(2)
}
----

// <How does Functional Programming with Go work?>

== Functional Programming in Elixir

[discrete]
==== Primitive Types

Before talking about functional programming in Elixir, the general types of Elixir must be discussed. Elixir uses primitive types similar to Go but simpler by skipping the size option of numbers. Additionally, it has atoms, a feature of prolog that was passed over from Erlang to Elixir. Atoms are constant identifiers that have the same value as their name. 

.types.ex
[source,elixir]
----
# Primitive Types
string = "Hello, World!"
string = "Hello, #{:world}"
bool = false || true
integer = 1
float = 1.0
atom = :atom

# List, Maps and Tuples
list = [1, 2, 3]
map = %{"hello" => "world"}
tuple = {:red, :green, :blue}
----

[discrete]
==== Modules and Functions

Functions in Elixir can be anonymous or inside a module. Elixir does not use curly brackets for distinquishing scopes. Instead keywords are used. Scopes are restricted by `do` and `end`.

.types (functions)
[source,elixir]
----
add = fn a, b -> a + b end
add.(2, 2)
----

Here the function `add` is defined as an anonymous function. Anonymous functions use `\->` instead `do`. Calling the function is quite unusual by the need of a dot before the argument list in brackets. A very important quirk of Elixir is the absence of a return keyword. Every anonymous and named function returns the last statement. This is a big change and has impact on development.

.types.ex (modules)
[source,elixir]
----
defmodule Greeter do
    @type subject :: String
    @type message :: String

    @spec greet(subject, message) :: String
    def greet(subject, message) do
        combine_greeting(subject, message)
    end

    defp combine_greeting(subject, message) do
        "Hello, #{subject}!\n#{message}"
    end
end

Greeter.greet("World", "Here is Elixir")
----

Only modules in Elixir start with a capital letter. Private functions are prefixed by the keyword `defp` while normal functions just use `def`. Elixir also allows the definition of structs using `defstruct`.

// < => vs -> vs |> >

[discrete]
==== First-class citizens

The previously defined anonymous function `add` and the following function increment are examples for assigning functions to variables.

.first_class_citizens (functions)
[source,elixir]
----
increment = fn x -> x + 1
g = &Greeter.greet/2
----

[discrete]
==== Currying

.currying.ex
[source,elixir]
----
multiply = fn x, y -> x * y end
multiplyC = fn x ->
    fn y -> x * y end
end

multiply.(2, 2)
multiplyC.(2).(2)
----

== Comparison of Functional Programming

Since modern programming languages have features of many paradigms like object-orientation or functional programming, they can be more precisly differentiated with orthogonal classifications. Just like Go that has C++ background Elixir builds on top of the language Erlang. Various orthogonal classifications are listed in the table <<_orthogonal_classifications,Orthogonal Classifications>>. 

.Orthogonal Classifications
|===
| Go | Elixir

|Static Typed
|Dynamic Typed

|Compiled
|Compiled

|Parallel
|Sequential?

|Static Linked
|Dynamic Linked?

|Platform Dependent Assemblercode
|Platform Independent Bytecode
|===

Elixir in comparison to Go has dynamic types, meaning it evaluates types at runtime. Elixir and Go have different types and typing approaches. Elixir for example does not have strict types. Like in coffeescript types in Elixir can be added through annotations or decorators.

Both Elixir and Go are compiled. Go is compiled into one binary executable while Elixir is compiled into Beam files, which are compatible to the Erlang VM. 
// The pros and cons of each output are countless.

// <moduls, plugins, require, import>

| First-class citizens | Yes | Yes
| Higher-order functions | Yes | Yes
| Lazy evaluation | No | Partial

=== Lambda Calculus

// <What is the lambda calculus?>
The lambda calculus is a logic language used in computer science. In the lambda calculus everything is a function. Numbers, if-statements and more computational tasks can be expressed in the lambda calculus via functions. All functions in the lambda calculus are unary.
// <Connection to functional programming>

Three prominent functions of the lambda calculus are represented in the following two examples for Go and Elixir. The identity function `i` returns its argument. The function `t` expresses a `true`. A `false` is implemented in `f`. 

.lambda_calculus.go
[source,go]
----
type function func(function) function

func t(x function) function {
	return func(y function) function {
		return x
	}
}

func f(x function) function {
	return func(y function) function {
		return y
	}
}

func i(x function) function {
	return x
}
----

// <How is it implemented in Go?>
Go allows the declaration of custom types. The type `function` is defined as function that takes a `function` and returns a `function`.

.lambda_calculus.ex
[source,elixir]
----
t = fn x ->
  fn _y -> x end
end

f = fn _x ->
  fn y -> y end
end

i = fn x -> x end
----

// <How is it implemented in Elixir?>
The three functions: identity, true and false share the similar concept in Elixir. But here they are much more compact. For once the functions are anonymous and `return` keywords are omitted. The absence of type information shortens the code even further.
// <named unused arguments in Exlixir but not in go>

=== Example Application

Since Go and Elixir share the webserver usecase functional will be compared with an example application that represents a simple http server.

// <Compare HTTP server code structure>
Go comes with a HTTP module

// <[Compare HTTP request responsetimes]>
